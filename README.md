## DeHealth

### Abstract
DeHealth is a concept to create a Decentralised Health Identity for every patient in the world. The health records of patients are stored on the blockchain and are made available to only authorized people/personnel.
The records(made immutable and secure through blockchain) are stored through IPFS technology and will be accessible through our web portal.
Patients may add/delete their health history as long as there is relevant proof for a certificate being valid. Doctors who prescribed the necessary diagnosis have access to those documents. Also, new doctors can be given access tho those docs as and when required by the patients.
